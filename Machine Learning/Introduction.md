# Machine Learning

## What is Machine Learning ?

subset of artificial intelligence that is mainly concerned with machine or applications

**`Learning`** is any process by which a system improves performance from experience


There is another definition by `Tom Mitchel 1998`
ML is the study  of algorithm that 
- improve thier perfomance `P` 
- at some task `T` 
- with experience `E`

## Traditional programming VS Machine Learning

### Traditional programming
```
    computer inputs                computer output
-------------------------------------------------------
{ Data   &&    Program } => Computer => Output 
```
### Machine Learning
```
    computer inputs                computer output
-------------------------------------------------------
{ Data   &&    expected Output } => Computer => Program 
```

## How does the Machine Learining work ?
A Machine learning learns form historical data, builds the prediction models, and whenever it recieves the new data,predicts the output for it. The accuracy of predicted output depends upon the amount of data, as the huge amount of data helps to build a better model which predicts the output more accurately.

## Features of machine learnig
- uses to detect various pattern in a given dataset
- it can learn from past data and improve it automatically
- machine learning is much similar to data mining as it also deals with the huge amount of data 

## Why we need for machine learning ?
the reason behind the need for machine learning that it can perfom tasks which is too complex to the human to perform it 

## Some Applications on Machine learning
- Image Recognition
- speech recognition
- Google Assistant
- Online Fraud Detection
- Stock Market Trade
- Medical Diagnosis
- Auto Language translation
